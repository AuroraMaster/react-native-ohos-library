## 2. Link
This library depends on the following third-party libraries. Please refer to their respective documentation:
+ [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-gesture-handler](/zh-cn/react-native-gesture-handler.md)
+ [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated](/zh-cn/react-native-reanimated.md)

This library implementation relies on the native code of @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-gesture-handler and @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated. If this library has already been introduced in the HarmonyOS project, there is no need to add it again. You can skip the steps in this section and use it directly.

If not introduced, please refer to the Link sections of the [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-gesture-handler documentation](/zh-cn/react-native-gesture-handler.md#link) and [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated documentation](/zh-cn/react-native-reanimated.md#link) to include them.

### 3.1 Compatibility

## 4. Properties (If Any)

> [!TIP] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!TIP] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

| Name        | Description                                       | Type   | Required | Platform  | HarmonyOS Support |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |-----------|-------------------|
| data | Items to be rendered. | Object | yes      | all       | yes               |
| ref | FlatList ref to be forwarded to the underlying FlatList. | Object | no     | all       | yes               |
| renderItem | Call drag when the row should become active (i.e. in an onLongPress or onPressIn). | function | yes     | all       | yes               |
| renderPlaceholder | Component to be rendered underneath the hovering component. | function | no     | all       | yes               |
| keyExtractor | nique key for each item (required). | function | yes     | all       | yes               |
| onDragBegin | Called when row becomes active. | function | no     | all       | yes               |
| onRelease | Called when active row touch ends. | function | no     | all       | yes               |
| onDragEnd | Called after animation has completed. Returns updated ordering of data. | function | no     | all       | yes               |

| autoscrollSpeed | Determines how fast the list autoscrolls. | number | no     | all       | yes               |
| animationConfig | Configure list animations. | Object | no     | all       | yes               |
| activationDistance | Distance a finger must travel before the gesture handler activates. Useful when using a draggable list within a TabNavigator so that the list does not capture navigator gestures. | number | no     | all       | yes               |

| dragHitSlop | Enables control over what part of the connected view area can be used to begin recognizing the gesture. Numbers need to be non-positive (only possible to reduce responsive area). | Object | no     | no        | no                |
| debug | Enables debug logging and animation debugger. | boolean | no     | all       | yes               |
| containerStyle | Style of the main component. | Object | no     | all       | yes               |

| itemEnteringAnimation | Animation when item is added to list. | function | no     | partially | no                |
| itemExitingAnimation | Animation when item is removed from list. | function | no     | partially | no                |
| itemLayoutAnimation | Animation when list items change position (enableLayoutAnimationExperimental prop must be true). | function | no     | partially | no                |
| enableLayoutAnimationExperimental | Flag to turn on experimental support for itemLayoutAnimation. | boolean | no     | partially | no                |
 

## 5. Known Issues

- [X] The four properties itemEnteringAnimation, itemExitingAnimation, itemLayoutAnimation, and enableLayoutAnimationExperimental rely on the react-native-reanimated animation library. Since the animation library has not yet implemented this feature, these properties currently have no effect.  issue: [issue#2](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-draggable-flatlist/issues/2).

## 6. Others

- [X] The simultaneousHandlers、dragHitSlop source library has no effect. Issue: [issue#1](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-draggable-flatlist/issues/1).

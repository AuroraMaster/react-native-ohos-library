## Installation and Usage

> [!TIP] Need matching services and third-party dependencies.

react-native-video-controls depends on the follow third-party library:

| Dependencies       | Version |
| :----------------- | :------ |
| react-native-video | >=2.0.0 |
| lodash             | ^4.16.4 |

The library depends on [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-video](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/react-native-video.md#link) and simplify development JS tool [lodash](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/lodash.md)

Go to the project directory and execute the following instruction:

#### **npm**

```bash
npm install --save react-native-video-controls
```

#### **yarn**

```bash
yarn add react-native-video-controls
```

The following code shows the basic use scenario of the repository:

> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.

```js
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";
import VideoPlayer from 'react-native-video-controls';

const App = () => {
  function handleOnBack() {
    alert("this is onBack event test,because navigator properties depends on others parity");
  }
  return(
      <View>
       <VideoPlayer
      		title = 'oceans'
      		style = {styles.container}
         	videoStyle = {styles.video}
            source = {{ uri: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4' }}
            toggleResizeModeOnFullscreen = {true}
            controlAnimationTiming = {3000}
            doubleTapTime = {10}
            controlTimeout = {4000}
            scrubbing = {5}
			onBack = {handleOnBack}
            showOnStart = {false}
            seekColor = {'#00FFFF'}
            tapAnywhereToPause = {true}
        />
     </View>
    );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#000',
  }, 
  video: {  
    width: '100%',  
    height: '100%',  
  },
});

export default App;
```

## Link

The HarmonyOS implementation of this library depends on the native code from @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-video. If this library is included into your HarmonyOS application, there is no need to include it again; you can skip the steps in this section and use it directly. If it is not included, follow the guide provided in @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-video to add it to your project.

If not introduce the library, please refer to [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-video document](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/react-native-video.md#link) and [lodash document](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/lodash.md) for introducingã€‚After finished installation, please use command `npm list react-native-video` and `npm list lodash` in terminal, and check if the component video version and lodash tool version are correct.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

This document is verified based on the following versions:

1. RNOH: 0.72.28; SDK: HarmonyOS NEXT Developer Beta3 5.0.0.36(12 Beta3); IDE: DevEco Studio 5.0.3.535; ROM: 5.0.0.31;

## Properties

> [!tip] The Platform column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!tip]  If the value of HarmonyOS Support is yes, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; no means the opposite; partially means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

> [!tip] While Name column property navigator is in usage, please refer to this document's others.

## Known Issues

## Others

+ If Source library doesn't offer navigator property function and not offer this property's dependency, navigation related library can offer this property functions. For the usage please refer to [react-navigation-stack document](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/react-navigation-stack.md) and [react-navigation-native document](https://gitee.com/react-native-oh-library/usage-docs/blob/master/en/react-navigation-native.md) introducing navigation related library.

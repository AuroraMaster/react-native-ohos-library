## Installation and Usage

Find the matching version information in the release address of a third-party libraryï¼š[@react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/mixpanel-react-native/releases).For older versions that are not published to npm, please refer to the [installation guide](/en/tgz-usage-en.md) to install the tgz package.

Go to the project directory and execute the following instruction:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **npm**

```bash
npm install @react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native
```


#### **yarn**

```bash
yarn add @react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

The following code shows the basic use scenario of the repository:

> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.
> [!WARNING] The token value used in the code needs to be obtained from the project settings on the[ Mixpanel website](https://mixpanel.com),After an event is sent, you can view the corresponding data in the project analytics on the[ Mixpanel website](https://mixpanel.com)

```js
import React from 'react';
import {Button, SafeAreaView} from 'react-native';
import {Mixpanel} from 'mixpanel-react-native';

const trackAutomaticEvents = false;
const token = 'Your Project Token';
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(token, trackAutomaticEvents);
mixpanel.init();

export default function MixpanelDemo() {
    return (
    <SafeAreaView>
        <Button
    title="Select Premium Plan"
    onPress={() => mixpanel.track('Plan Selected', {Plan: 'Premium'})}
/>
    </SafeAreaView>
);
}
```

## Use Codegen

If this repository has been adapted to `Codegen`, generate the bridge code of the third-party library by using the `Codegen`. For details, see [Codegen Usage Guide](/en/codegen.md).

## Link

Currently, HarmonyOS does not support AutoLink. Therefore, you need to manually configure the linking.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2.Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:

Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
"@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",
"@react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native/harmony/mixpanel.har"
}
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 3. Introducing MixpanelPackage to ArkTS

 Open the `entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import { MixpanelPackage } from '@react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native/ts';

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
    new SamplePackage(ctx),
+   new MixpanelPackage(ctx)
  ];
}
```

### 4.Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/mixpanel-react-native Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/mixpanel-react-native/releases)

## API

> [!tip] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!tip] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

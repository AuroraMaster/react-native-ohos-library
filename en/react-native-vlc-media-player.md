> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.

```js
import {useRef, useState } from 'react';
import {
  StyleSheet,
  ScrollView,
  View,
  StatusBar,
} from 'react-native';
import { VLCPlayer } from 'react-native-vlc-media-player';

function App() {
  const vlcPlayerRef = useRef(null);
  return (
    <ScrollView 
      style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff' }}
      contentContainerStyle={{ paddingBottom: 150 }}
    >

      <StatusBar barStyle="dark-content" />
      <View style={styles.videoContainer}>
        <VLCPlayer
          ref={vlcPlayerRef}
          source={{
            initType: 2,
            uri: "rtmp://ns8.indexforce.com/home/mystream",
            initOptions: [
              '--verbose=4'
            ],
          }}
          autoplay={true}
          style={styles.backgroundVideo}
          onPlaying={(event) => {
            console.log(`${event}`)
          }}
        />
      </View>
    </ScrollView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  backgroundVideo: {
    width: '100%',

    padding: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

## Link

This step provides guidance for manually configuring native dependencies.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2. Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:

Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",
    "@react-native-ohos/react-native-vlc-media-player": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-ohos/react-native-vlc-media-player/harmony/rn_vlc.har"
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 3. Configuring CMakeLists and Introducing RNVlcMediaPlayerPackage

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and add the following code:

```diff
project(rnapp)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)
set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH TRUE)
set(RNOH_APP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
set(NODE_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../node_modules")
+ set(OH_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../oh_modules")
set(RNOH_CPP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../../react-native-harmony/harmony/cpp")
set(LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL 1)
set(CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS "-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument -Qunused-arguments")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-fstack-protector-strong -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now,-z,noexecstack -s -fPIE -pie")
set(WITH_HITRACE_SYSTRACE 1) # for other CMakeLists.txt files to use
add_compile_definitions(WITH_HITRACE_SYSTRACE)

add_subdirectory("${RNOH_CPP_DIR}" ./rn)

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_1
add_subdirectory("../../../../sample_package/src/main/cpp" ./sample-package)
+ add_subdirectory("${OH_MODULES}/@react-native-ohos/react-native-vlc-media-player/src/main/cpp" ./rn_vlc)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_1

file(GLOB GENERATED_CPP_FILES "./generated/*.cpp")

add_library(rnoh_app SHARED
    ${GENERATED_CPP_FILES}
    "./PackageProvider.cpp"
    "${RNOH_CPP_DIR}/RNOHAppNapiBridge.cpp"
)
target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh)

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_2
target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_sample_package)
+ target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_vlc)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_2
```

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/PackageProvider.cpp` and add the following code:

```diff
#include "RNOH/PackageProvider.h"
#include "generated/RNOHGeneratedPackage.h"
#include "SamplePackage.h"
+ #include "RNVlcMediaPlayerPackage.h"

using namespace rnoh;

std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Package>> PackageProvider::getPackages(Package::Context ctx) {
    return {
        std::make_shared<RNOHGeneratedPackage>(ctx),
        std::make_shared<SamplePackage>(ctx),
+       std::make_shared<RNVlcMediaPlayerPackage>(ctx),
    };
}
```

### Introduce the RNVLC component on the ArkTs side

Open the `entry/src/main/ets/pages/index.ets` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import {RNVLC, RNC_VLC_TYPE} from "@react-native-ohos/react-native-vlc-media-player"
@Builder
export function buildCustomRNComponent(ctx: ComponentBuilderContext) {
  ...
+ if (ctx.componentName === RNC_VLC_TYPE) {
+   RNVLC({
+     ctx: ctx.rnComponentContext,
+     tag: ctx.tag
+   })
+ }
...
}
...
```

### 5. Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Known Issues

- [ ] The functions onRecordingCreated, startRecording, and stopRecording are custom video recording features for Android and iOS. They have not been merged into the mainline version of the libvlc library and therefore will not be implemented.[issues](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vlc-media-player/issues/10)
- [ ] The repeat property provides loop playback functionality. It is not implemented on either Android or iOS and will not be implemented on HarmonyOS.[issues](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vlc-media-player/issues/10)
- [ ] The playInBackground property enables background playback. This feature is not implemented on Android or iOS. On HarmonyOS, background playback requires users to explicitly request background permissions; therefore, it will not be implemented.[issues](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vlc-media-player/issues/10)
- [ ] The resizeMode property controls the video scaling/fill mode. It is not implemented on Android or iOS and will not be implemented on HarmonyOS.[issues](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vlc-media-player/issues/10)
- [ ] The style field of VLCPlayerProps is not implemented on either Android or ios. It has been aligned with SE and is not implemented on HarmonyOS either.[issues](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vlc-media-player/issues/10)

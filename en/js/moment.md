## APIs

For details, see the [Moment.js Documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/).

The following **moment** is the object exported from **moment.js**:

```bash
import moment from 'moment';
```

The following code shows the basic use scenarios of the repository:

```js
// Obtain 00:00:00 today.
moment().startOf("day");
// Obtain 00:00:00 in the first day of the current month.
moment().startOf("month");
// Obtain the total number of days of the current month.
moment().daysInMonth();
// Obtain the timestamp (in seconds).
moment().format("X"); // The return value is of the string type.
moment().unix (); // The return value is of the numeric type.
// Obtain the timestamp (in milliseconds).
moment().format("x"); // The return value is of the string type.
moment().valueOf(); // The return value is of the numeric type.

moment().date();
moment().get("date");
// Obtain the hour.
moment().hours();
moment().get("hours");
// Obtain the minute.

| toJSON      | When serializing an object to JSON, if there is a Moment object, it will be represented as an ISO8601 string, adjusted to UTC. | function | no       | yes               |
| toISOString | Formats a string to the ISO8601 standard.                    | function | no       | yes               |
| toObject    | This returns an object containing year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, seconds, milliseconds. | function | no       | yes               |
| toString    | Returns an english string in a similar format to JS Date's .toString(). | function | no       | yes               |
| inspect     | Returns a machine readable string, that can be evaluated to produce the same moment. Because of the name it is also used in node interactive shell to display objects. | function | no       | yes               |

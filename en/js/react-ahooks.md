| :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------: | :------: | :---------------: |
|        Quick Start         | The first parameter of **useRequest** is an asynchronous function, which will be automatically triggered when the component is first loaded. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        Basic usage         | Manages the status of **loading**, **data**, **error** of the asynchronous function. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       Loading Delay        | Delays the time when **loading** turns to **true** by setting **options.loadingDelay**, effectively preventing UI flashing. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|          Polling           | Enters the polling mode by setting **options.pollingInterval**. **useRequest** periodically triggers service execution. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|           Ready            | Controls whether to send a request by setting **options.ready**. If **options.ready** is set to **false**, the request will never be sent. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        RefreshDeps         | By setting **options.refreshDeps**, **useRequest** automatically invokes [refresh](https://ahooks.js.org/hooks/use-request/basic/#result) when dependencies change, achieving the effect of [refresh](https://ahooks.js.org/hooks/use-request/basic/#refresh-repeat-the-last-request). | Function |   All    |        yes        |

|          Debounce          | Enters the debounce mode by setting **options.debounceWait**. At this time, if **run** or **runAsync** is triggered frequently, the request will be executed with the debounce strategy. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|          Throttle          | Enters the throttle mode by setting **options.throttleWait**. At this time, if **run** or **runAsync** is triggered frequently, the request will be executed with the throttle strategy. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        Cache & SWR         | Sets the data retention time through **options.staleTime**. During this time, the data is considered to be fresh and the request will not be re-initiated. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        Error Retry         | Specifies the number of retry times by setting `options.retryCount`.** useRequest** will retry after a failure. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|      useHistoryTravel      | Manages state change history to facilitate forward and backward operations in historical records. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useCountDown        |                      Manages countdown.                      | Function |   All    |        yes        |

|        useWebSocket        |                      Handles WebSocket.                      | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|          useMount          |   Executes a function only when the component is mounted.    | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useUnmount         |     Executes a function when the component is unmounted.     | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|      useUnmountedRef       |         Obtains whether the component is unmounted.          | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useSetState         | Manages the state of object type, which is similar to the usage of **this.setState** of the **class** component. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useBoolean         |             Manages the boolean state elegantly.             | Function |   All    |        yes        |

|        useRafState         | Updates the state in [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), generally used for performance optimization. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useSafeState        | Works in the same way as **React.useState**. However, after the component is unmounted, **setState** in the asynchronous callback is not executed to avoid memory leakage caused by state update. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useGetState         | Adds a **getter** method to the return value of **React.useState** to get the latest value. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useResetState        | Provides a method to reset the state. This hook works similar to **React.useState**. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|      useUpdateEffect       | Runs the effect when dependencies are updated, but skips running the effect for the first time. This hook works in the same way as **useEffect**. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|   useUpdateLayoutEffect    | Runs the effect when dependencies are updated, but skips running the effect for the first time. This hook works in the same way as **useLayoutEffect**. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useAsyncEffect       |        Runs the effect using asynchronous functions.         | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|     useDebounceEffect      |                   Debounces **useEffect**.                   | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useDebounceFn        |              Deals with the debounce functions.              | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useThrottleFn        |              Deals with the throttle functions.              | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|     useThrottleEffect      |                   Throttles **useEffect**.                   | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|    useDeepCompareEffect    | Works in the same way as **useEffect**, but **deps** is compared with [lodash isEqual](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isEqual). | Function |   All    |        yes        |
| useDeepCompareLayoutEffect | Works in the same way as **useLayoutEffect**, but **deps** is compared with [lodash isEqual](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isEqual). | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useInterval         |         Handles the **setInterval** timer function.          | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useRafInterval       | Implements **setInterval** with **requestAnimationFrame**. This hook works in the same way as **useInterval**. The advantage is that the timer can be stopped when the page is not rendered, for example, the page is hidden or minimized. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useTimeout         |          Handles the **setTimeout** timer function.          | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useRafTimeout        | Implements **setTimeout** with **requestAnimationFrame**. The API is consistent with **useTimeout**. The advantage is that function execution is not triggered when the page is not rendered, for example, the page is hidden or minimized. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useLockFn          | Adds a lock to an asynchronous function to prevent parallel executions. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useUpdate          | Returns a function which can be used to force the component to re-render. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|   useControllableValuet    | Manages the states of some components whose states can be managed by themselves or controlled by their parents. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useCreation         | Substitutes for **useMemo** or **useRef** because **useMemo** cannot ensure that the memoized value will not be recalculated, while **useCreation** can ensure that. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|      useEventEmitter       |    Obtains an instance of **EventEmitter** in components.    | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|         useLatest          |     Returns the latest value to avoid closure problems.      | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|       useMemoizedFn        | Handles persistent functions. In general, **useMemoizedFn** can substitute for **useCallback**. For special cases, see [FAQ](https://ahooks.js.org/hooks/use-memoized-fn/#faq). | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|        useReactive         | Provides data reactivity during operations, in which case **useState** is unnecessary for state definition. Modifying properties will automatically lead to view rerendering. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|      useTrackedEffect      | Tracks which dependency change triggers the execution of **useEffect**. | Function |   All    |        yes        |
|     useWhyDidYouUpdate     |    Locates the properties that caused component rerender.    | Function |   All    |        yes        |

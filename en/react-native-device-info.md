## Installation and Usage

Find the matching version information in the release address of a third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-device-info/releases).For older versions that are not published to npm, please refer to the [installation guide](/en/tgz-usage-en.md) to install the tgz package.

Go to the project directory and execute the following instruction:



<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **npm**

```bash
npm install @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info
```

#### **yarn**

```bash
yarn add @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

The following code shows the basic use scenario of the repository:

> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.

```js

import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';
  DeviceInfo.getBundleId();
  DeviceInfo.getVersion();
  DeviceInfo.getReadableVersion();
  DeviceInfo.getBuildNumber();
  DeviceInfo.isTablet();
  DeviceInfo.getApplicationName();
  DeviceInfo.getBrand();
  DeviceInfo.getModel();
  DeviceInfo.getDeviceType();
```
## Use Codegen

This repository has been adapted to `Codegen`, generate the bridge code of the third-party library by using the `Codegen`. For details, see [Codegen Usage Guide](/en/codegen.md).

## Link

Currently, HarmonyOS does not support AutoLink. Therefore, you need to manually configure the linking.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2. Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:


Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",
    "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info/harmony/device_info.har"
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).


### 3. Introducing RNDeviceInfoPackage to ArkTS

Open the `entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import {RNDeviceInfoPackage} from '@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info/ts';

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
    new SamplePackage(ctx),
+   new RNDeviceInfoPackage(ctx)
  ];
}
```

### 4. Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library:[@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-device-info Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-device-info/releases)


### Permission Requirements

#### Add permissions in the module.json5 file under the entry directory.

Open `entry/src/main/module.json5`, add the following permissionï¼š

```diff
...
"requestPermissions": [
  {
    "name": "ohos.permission.GET_NETWORK_INFO"
  },
  {
    "name": "ohos.permission.GET_WIFI_INFO"
  }
]
```

## API

> [!tip] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!tip] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

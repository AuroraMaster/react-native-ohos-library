## 2. Manual Link

This step provides guidance for manually configuring native dependencies.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 2.1 Overrides RN SDK

To ensure the project relies on the same version of the RN SDK, you need to add an `overrides` field in the project's root `oh-package.json5` file, specifying the RN SDK version to be used. The replacement version can be a specific version number, a semver range, or a locally available HAR package or source directory.

For more information about the purpose of this field, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-oh-package-json5-V5#en-us_topic_0000001792256137_overrides).

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "^0.72.38" // ohpm version
    // "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony.har" // a locally available HAR package
    // "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony" // source code directory
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:

- Use the HAR file.
- Directly link to the source code。

Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-sound-player": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-sound-player/harmony/rn_sound_player.har"
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 2.3 Configuring CMakeLists and Introducing RNSoundPlayerPackage

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and add the following code:

```diff
+ set(OH_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../oh_modules")

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_1
+ add_subdirectory("${OH_MODULES}/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-sound-player/src/main/cpp" ./sound-player)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_1

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_2
+ target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_sound_player)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_2
```

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/PackageProvider.cpp` and add the following code:

```diff
#include "RNOH/PackageProvider.h"
#include "generated/RNOHGeneratedPackage.h"
+ #include "RNSoundPlayerPackage.h"

using namespace rnoh;

std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Package>> PackageProvider::getPackages(Package::Context ctx) {
    return {
        std::make_shared<RNOHGeneratedPackage>(ctx),
+        std::make_shared<RNSoundPlayerPackage>(ctx)
    };
}
```


### 2.4 Introducing RNSoundPlayerPackage Package to ArkTS

Open the `entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import {RNSoundPlayerPackage} from '@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-sound-player/ts';

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
+   new RNSoundPlayerPackage(ctx)
  ];
}
```

### 2.5 Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## 3. Constraints

### 3.1 Compatibility

## 4. Properties (If Any)

> [!TIP] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!TIP] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

## 5. Known Issues

- [X] Since the system side has not yet provided synchronization methods for generating and controlling the AVPlayer, the synchronization function implemented by the library, which relies on AVPlayer, remains unimplemented. This will be supplemented once the system side provides the necessary methods.  issue: [issue#6](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-sound-player/issues/6)

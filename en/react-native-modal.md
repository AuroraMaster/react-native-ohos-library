```ts
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import Modal from "react-native-modal";

type Props = {
	onPress: () => any;
};
type State<P> = P & {
	visible: boolean;
};

const DefaultModalContent: React.FC<Props> = (props) => (
	<View style={styles.content}>
		<Text style={styles.contentTitle}>Hi ðŸ‘‹!</Text>
		<Button testID={"close-button"} onPress={props.onPress} title="Close" />
	</View>
);

abstract class ModalBaseScene<P extends object = {}> extends Component<any, State<P>> {
	abstract renderModal(): React.ReactElement<any>;
	// @ts-ignore
	constructor(props, state?: P) {
		super(props);
		// @ts-ignore
		this.state = {
			...state,
			visible: false
		};
	}

	open = () => this.setState({ visible: true } as any);
	close = () => this.setState({ visible: false } as any);
	isVisible = () => this.state.visible;
	public renderButton(): React.ReactElement<any> {
		return <Button testID={"modal-open-button"} onPress={this.open} title="Open" />;
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<View style={styles.view}>
				{this.renderButton()}
				{this.renderModal()}
			</View>
		);
	}
}

class DefaultModal extends ModalBaseScene {
	renderModal(): React.ReactElement<any> {
		return (
			<Modal testID={"modal"} isVisible={this.isVisible()}>
				<DefaultModalContent onPress={this.close} />
			</Modal>
		);
	}
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
	view: {
		flex: 1,
		alignItems: "center",
		justifyContent: "center"
	},
	content: {
		backgroundColor: "white",
		padding: 22,

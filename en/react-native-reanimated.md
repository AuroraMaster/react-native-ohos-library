## Installation and Usage

Find the matching version information in the release address of a third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-harmony-reanimated/releases).For older versions that are not published to npm, please refer to the [installation guide](/en/tgz-usage-en.md) to install the tgz package.

Go to the project directory and execute the following instruction:



<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **npm**

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@3.6.0
npm install @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated
```

#### **yarn**

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated@3.6.0
yarn add @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Add react-native-reanimated/plugin to `babel.config.js`:

> [!TIP] Why is this needed? The Reanimated Babel plugin automatically converts special JavaScript functions (called worklets) so that they can be passed and run on the UI thread.

```js
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      ... // don't add it here :)
    ],
    plugins: [
      ...
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
```

Clear the Metro cache (recommended):

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **npm**

```bash
npm start --reset-cache
```

#### **yarn**

```bash
yarn start --reset-cache
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

The following code shows the basic use scenario of the repository:

> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.

```js
import { Button, View } from "react-native";
import Animated, { useSharedValue, withSpring } from "react-native-reanimated";

export default function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  const handlePress = () => {
    width.value = withSpring(width.value + 50);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Animated.View
        style={{
          width,
          height: 100,
          backgroundColor: "violet",
        }}
      />
      <Button onPress={handlePress} title="Click me" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Link

Currently, HarmonyOS does not support AutoLink. Therefore, you need to manually configure the linking.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2.Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:


Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",

    "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated/harmony/reanimated.har"
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 3. Configuring CMakeLists and Introducing ReanimatedPackage

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and add the following code:

```diff
project(rnapp)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)
set(RNOH_APP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
+ set(NODE_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../node_modules")
+ set(OH_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../oh_modules")
set(RNOH_CPP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../../react-native-harmony/harmony/cpp")

add_subdirectory("${RNOH_CPP_DIR}" ./rn)

# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_1
add_subdirectory("../../../../sample_package/src/main/cpp" ./sample-package)
+ add_subdirectory("${OH_MODULES}/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated/src/main/cpp" ./reanimated)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_1

add_library(rnoh_app SHARED
    "./PackageProvider.cpp"
    "${RNOH_CPP_DIR}/RNOHAppNapiBridge.cpp"
)

target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh)

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_2
target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_sample_package)
+ target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_reanimated)
# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_2
```
> [!Tip] **Note**: The NODE_MODULES path refers to the installation path of the source repository. Users can define NODE_MODULES based on the path where the source repository is installed.

Open`entry/src/main/cpp/PackageProvider.cpp` and add the following code:

```diff
#include "RNOH/PackageProvider.h"
#include "SamplePackage.h"
+ #include "ReanimatedPackage.h"

using namespace rnoh;

std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Package>> PackageProvider::getPackages(Package::Context ctx) {
    return {
      std::make_shared<SamplePackage>(ctx),
+     std::make_shared<ReanimatedPackage>(ctx)
    };
}
```

### 4. Introducing ReanimatedPackage to ArkTS 

Open`entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import { ReanimatedPackage } from '@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated/ts';

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
    new SamplePackage(ctx),
+   new ReanimatedPackage(ctx),
  ];
}
```

### 5. Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

This library is adapted based on react-native-reanimated (version=3.6.0). To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-reanimated Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-harmony-reanimated/releases)

## API

> [!TIP] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!TIP] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

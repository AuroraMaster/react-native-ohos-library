## Use Codegen

If this repository has been adapted to `Codegen`, generate the bridge code of the third-party library by using the `Codegen`. For details, see [Codegen Usage Guide](/en/codegen.md).

## Link

Currently, HarmonyOS does not support AutoLink. Therefore, you need to manually configure the linking.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2. Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:

Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",
    "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-system-setting": "../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-system-setting/harmony/react_native_system_setting.har"
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 3. Introducing RNSystemSettingPackage to ArkTS

Open the `entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import { RNSystemSettingPackage } from '@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-system-setting/ts';

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
    new SamplePackage(ctx),
+   new RNSystemSettingPackage(ctx)
  ];
}
```

### 4. Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library: [@react-native-oh-library/react-native-system-setting Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-system-setting/releases)。

### Permission Requirements

This library involves system control functions such as Bluetooth and brightness. Therefore, you need to configure the corresponding permission in the **module.json5** file in the **entry/src/main** directory when using the corresponding APIs. Some permissions need to be requested from users in a pop-up window. For details about the permission configuration, see [Application Access Control](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/security/AccessToken/Readme-EN.md#/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/security/AccessToken/app-permission-mgmt-overview.md)。

Some functions and APIs of this library require the **normal** permissions **ohos.permission.ACCESS_BLUETOOTH** and **ohos.permission.GET_WIFI_INFO**.

Some functions and APIs of this library require the [**full sdk**](https://eco-betaclub.rnd.huawei.com/#/download/DevEco%20Studio/newest) and [**system_basic**](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/determine-application-mode-0000001774120042-V5) permissions, such as **ohos.permission.MANAGE_SECURE_SETTINGS** and **ohos.permission.MANAGE_WIFI_CONNECTION**.

## API

> [!TIP] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!TIP] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

## Link

The HarmonyOS implementation of this library depends on the native code from @react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-webview. If this library is included into your HarmonyOS application, there is no need to include it again; you can skip the steps in this section and use it directly.

If it is not included, follow the guide provided in [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-webview](/en/react-native-webview.md) to add it to your project.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-qrcode](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-qrcode/releases)

## Properties

> [!TIP] The **Platform** column indicates the platform where the properties are supported in the original third-party library.

> [!TIP] If the value of **HarmonyOS Support** is **yes**, it means that the HarmonyOS platform supports this property; **no** means the opposite; **partially** means some capabilities of this property are supported. The usage method is the same on different platforms and the effect is the same as that of iOS or Android.

### QRCode

This library is a UI component library that implements corresponding functions by configuring attribute tags.

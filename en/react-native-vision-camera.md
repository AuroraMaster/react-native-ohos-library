> [!WARNING] The name of the imported repository remains unchanged.

```jsx
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Camera, useCameraDevice, useCameraFormat, useCameraPermission } from 'react-native-vision-camera';

export default function VisionCameraDemo() {
    const device = useCameraDevice('back');
    const format = useCameraFormat(device, [
        { videoResolution: { width: 3048, height: 2160 } },
        { fps: 60 },
    ]);
    const { hasPermission, requestPermission } = useCameraPermission();
    const camera = useRef<Camera>(null);

    if (!device) {
        return <Text>No Devices</Text>;
    }

    if (!hasPermission) {
        requestPermission();
    }

    const onTakePhoto = async () => {
        const photoFile = await camera.current?.takePhoto();
        console.log("takePhoto photoFile:" + photoFile);
    };

    return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Camera
                style={{ flex: 1 }}
                ref={camera}
                device={device}
                format={format}
                isActive={true}
                preview={true}
                photo={true}
            />
            <View style={{ width: '100%', position: 'absolute', bottom: 0, left: 0, zIndex: 999 }}>
                <Button title="photograph" onPress={onTakePhoto}></Button>
            </View>
        </View>
    );
}

```

## Link

Currently, HarmonyOS does not support AutoLink. Therefore, you need to manually configure the linking.

Open the `harmony` directory of the HarmonyOS project in DevEco Studio.

### 1. Adding the overrides Field to oh-package.json5 File in the Root Directory of the Project

```json
{
  ...
  "overrides": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony" : "./react_native_openharmony"
  }
}
```

### 2. Introducing Native Code

Currently, two methods are available:

 

Method 1 (recommended): Use the HAR file.

> [!TIP] The HAR file is stored in the `harmony` directory in the installation path of the third-party library.

Open `entry/oh-package.json5` file and add the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rnoh/react-native-openharmony": "file:../react_native_openharmony",
    "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera": "file:../../node_modules/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera/harmony/vision_camera.har",
  }
```

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Method 2: Directly link to the source code.

> [!TIP] For details, see [Directly Linking Source Code](/en/link-source-code.md).

### 3. Configuring CMakeLists and Introducing VisionCameraPackage

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and add the following code:

```diff
project(rnapp)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)
set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH TRUE)
set(RNOH_APP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
set(NODE_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../node_modules")
+ set(OH_MODULES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../oh_modules")
set(RNOH_CPP_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../../../react-native-harmony/harmony/cpp")
set(LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL 1)
set(CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS "-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument -Qunused-arguments")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-fstack-protector-strong -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now,-z,noexecstack -s -fPIE -pie")
set(WITH_HITRACE_SYSTRACE 1) # for other CMakeLists.txt files to use
add_compile_definitions(WITH_HITRACE_SYSTRACE)

add_subdirectory("${RNOH_CPP_DIR}" ./rn)

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_1
add_subdirectory("../../../../sample_package/src/main/cpp" ./sample-package)
+ add_subdirectory("${OH_MODULES}/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera/src/main/cpp" ./vision-camera)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_1

file(GLOB GENERATED_CPP_FILES "./generated/*.cpp")
+file(GLOB VISION_CAMERA_CPP_FILES "${OH_MODULES}/@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera/src/main/cpp/*.cpp")

add_library(rnoh_app SHARED
    ${GENERATED_CPP_FILES}
+    ${VISION_CAMERA_CPP_FILES}
    "./PackageProvider.cpp"
    "${RNOH_CPP_DIR}/RNOHAppNapiBridge.cpp"
)
target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh)

# RNOH_BEGIN: manual_package_linking_2
target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_sample_package)
+ target_link_libraries(rnoh_app PUBLIC rnoh_vision_camera)
# RNOH_END: manual_package_linking_2
```

Open `entry/src/main/cpp/PackageProvider.cpp` and add the following code:

```diff
#include "RNOH/PackageProvider.h"
#include "generated/RNOHGeneratedPackage.h"
#include "SamplePackage.h"
+#include "VisionCameraPackage.h"

using namespace rnoh;

std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Package>> PackageProvider::getPackages(Package::Context ctx) {
    return {
        std::make_shared<RNOHGeneratedPackage>(ctx),
        std::make_shared<SamplePackage>(ctx),
+       std::make_shared<VisionCameraPackage>(ctx),
    };
}
```

### 4. Introducing VisionCameraView Component to ArkTS

Find `function buildCustomRNComponent()`, which is usually located in `entry/src/main/ets/pages/index.ets` or `entry/src/main/ets/rn/LoadBundle.ets`, and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import { VisionCameraView } from "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera";

@Builder
export function buildCustomRNComponent(ctx: ComponentBuilderContext) {
  ...
+ if (ctx.componentName === VisionCameraView.NAME) {
+   VisionCameraView({
+     ctx: ctx.rnComponentContext,
+     tag: ctx.tag,
+   })
+ }
...
}
...
```
In `entry/src/main/ets/pages/index. ets`, if there is an `arkTsWidgetNames` array in the current file (which will be added in later versions), it is necessary to append `VisionCameraView` to it NAME`;

```ts
  ...
 const arkTsComponentNames: Array<string> = [..., VisionCameraView.NAME]; 
  ...
```

### 5. Introducing VisionCameraModulePackage to ArkTS

Open the `entry/src/main/ets/RNPackagesFactory.ts` file and add the following code:

```diff
  ...
+ import { VisionCameraModulePackage } from "@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera/ts";

export function createRNPackages(ctx: RNPackageContext): RNPackage[] {
  return [
    new SamplePackage(ctx),
+   new VisionCameraModulePackage(ctx),
  ];
}
```

### 6. Running

Click the `sync` button in the upper right corner.

Alternatively, run the following instruction on the terminal:

```bash
cd entry
ohpm install
```

Then build and run the code.

## Constraints

### Compatibility

To use this repository, you need to use the correct React-Native and RNOH versions. In addition, you need to use DevEco Studio and the ROM on your phone.

Check the release version information in the release address of the third-party library: [@react-native-oh-tpl/react-native-vision-camera Releases](https://github.com/react-native-oh-library/react-native-vision-camera/releases)

### Permission Requirements

Among the following permissions, there is the system_basic permission, while the default application permission is normal. Only normal level permissions can be used, so you may encounter an error 9568289 when installing the hap package. Please refer to the [document](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/bm-tool-V5#ZH-CN_TOPIC_0000001884757326__%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85hap%E6%97%B6%E6%8F%90%E7%A4%BAcode9568289-error-install-failed-due-to-grant-request-permissions-failed) to modify the application level to system_basic.

####  Include applicable permissions in the module.json5 file within the entry directory.

Open `entry/src/main/module.json5` and add the following code:

```diff
...
"requestPermissions": [
+  {
+    "name": "ohos.permission.CAMERA",
+    "reason": "$string:camera_reason",
+    "usedScene": {
+      "abilities": [
+        "EntryAbility"
+      ],
+      "when":"inuse"
+    }
+  },
+  {
+    "name": "ohos.permission.MICROPHONE",
+    "reason": "$string:microphone_reason",
+    "usedScene": {
+      "abilities": [
+        "EntryAbility"
+      ],
+      "when":"inuse"
+    }
+  },
+  {
+    "name": "ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION",
+    "reason": "$string:location_reason",
+    "usedScene": {
+      "abilities": [
+        "EntryAbility"
+      ],
+      "when":"inuse"
+    }
+  }
]
```

#### Apply the reasons for applicable permission in the entry directory.

Open `entry/src/main/resources/base/element/string.json` and add the following code:

```diff
...
{
  "string": [
+    {
+      "name": "camera_reason",
+      "value": "use camera"
+    },
+    {
+      "name": "location_reason",
+      "value": "Get current location"
+    },
+    {
+      "name": "microphone_reason",
+      "value": "Use microphone"
+    },
  ]
}
```
